# Linear-Regression

In this model I have created a linear regression model to predict the per capita income of Canada for 8 years.
sklearn is used to predict the linear model and the prediction is plotted using matplotlib.
I have used PyChram as my IDE and I would recommed either PyChram or Jupyter notebooks.

Note: You can use this code as an example and create your own prediction model.

Ex) Create a prediction model to predict the immigrants of an country.
